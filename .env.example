# We try to mock as much as possible so you don't have to have these set to anything real to contribute
# We also only use these variables when you're trying to use the APIs that need them (lazy initialization)
# If you need to work on the feature that uses the API, it must be set.
# If it's mocked in development, then you can set its value to nonsense.
# We'll label them by what feature you need them for and whether it's mocked.
