problemStatements:
  part1: Learning React is one thing. Building an app is another
  part2:
    Getting the tooling put together and structuring your app is tough when
    there are so many ways to do it
  part3:
    The decisions you make at the start of the application become increasingly
    difficult to change the longer you run with it. Changing them can be a
    distraction from the primary purpose of the app.
  part4:
    Frankly, some of these decisions don't matter a ton to the success of your
    project, but inconsistency will make maintainability suffer, so the
    decisions need to be solid so things remain constant.
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Setup a React App
    description:
      We'll be using modern tooling to create a client-side application with the
      tried and true `create-react-app`.
  - title: Component-oriented styling
    description:
      A component isn't a component without its styles. CSS can be a difficult
      part of your application if you're not intentional about that
      relationship. When we're through, you'll know how to connect your
      components to the styles in a way that will help you know what impact your
      changes will make on the rest of the app.
  - title: Managing web forms
    description:
      Forms are a key part any modern website. Once you've gone through this
      workshop, you'll have the tools to build accessible forms that manage
      state in a maintainable and testable way.
  - title: Make HTTP requests to get data
    description:
      A website that doesn't get data is pretty limited. Most of the websites
      you'll build will have some data requirements. When we're done with this,
      you'll have the right idea of how to make client-side data requests with
      React.
topics:
  - Bootstrap a new react application with create-react-app
  - Styling Components with modern tools
  - Manage login and registration forms
  - Data fetching and managing lists of data

prerequisite: >-
  Attend my [React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks), or have the
  equivalent basic experience of using basic hooks. You should be experienced
  with creating custom React components and the `useState`, `useEffect`, and
  `useRef` hooks.
