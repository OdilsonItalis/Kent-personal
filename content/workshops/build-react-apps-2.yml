  authentication.

problemStatements:
  part1:
    Ensuring users are shown what they're allowed to see requires getting a lot
    of things right
  part2:
    It's important to structure your code to optimize both what the user is
    shown and what data is loaded
  part3:
    Organizing data you retrieve from the server is the bane of many a
    developer's existance. Making certain that your cache of the server data is
    up-to-date is a huge source of code complexity in web applications.
  part4:
    The URL is one of the Web's biggest strong points and thanks to some
    fantastic tools, we can use it to our advantage. But how do you make certain
    that an unauthorized user can't get to pages they don't have access to?
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Manage server state in your app
    description:
      This is one of the biggest challenges developers have in application
      development. I'm excited to show you how `react-query` can drastically
      simplify the way you think about state management in React apps. When
      we're done, you'll confidently install and integrate `react-query` into
      your own client-side React app.
  - title: Add Authentication to your app
    description:
      Regardless of whether you use a service or roll your own authentication,
      much of the React portion of this is the same, and you'll come away from
      this workshop ready to apply it to your own apps' authentication strategy.
  - title: Route your app
    description:
      We'll go over routing your React app with the latest version of the tried
      and true `react-router` library. And we'll answer the age-old question of
      how to prevent users from seeing authentication-only pages.
topics:
  - Support client-side routing with react-router
  - Authentication
  - Use react-query to manage client-side cache of backend data

prerequisite: >-
  Attend my [React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks), or have the
  equivalent basic experience of using basic hooks. You should be experienced
  with creating custom React components and the `useState`, `useEffect`, and
  `useRef` hooks. Attend my [Build React Apps (Part 1)
  Workshop](/workshops/build-react-apps-1), or have the equivalent basic
  experience of building basic React apps.
