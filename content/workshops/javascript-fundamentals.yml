# ### Take someone with no knowledge of computer programming and get them started with JavaScript

# Interested in learning to program?

# Do you want to build the next Facebook?

# Or even just a little custom app to track (and reduce) your trips to the soda
# machine?

# JavaScript can get you there. It’s:

# <ul>
#   <li>the most ubiquitous programming language around</li>
#   <li> the foundation of popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Redux</li>
#   <li> what enables webpages to interact (hence “the internet”)</li>
# </ul>

# ## The Workshop

# Hi, I’m Kent C. Dodds! In this workshop, I’ll help you build a foundation in
# JavaScript. We will start out with common elements in JavaScript, build up to
# variables and functions, and finally use Netlify to put your code on the web.

# By the end of the workshop, you will:

# <ul>
# </ul>
