      that abstraction effectively.

  You should have experience with [these JavaScript
  features](/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react). Experience with HTML, CSS, and
  DOM APIs will also be really helpful. This workshop will use TypeScript, but
  should be completable if you do not have experience with TypeScript (or you
  could attend my [TypeScript to know for
  React](/workshops/typescript-to-know-for-react) workshop first).
