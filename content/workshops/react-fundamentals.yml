# ### Learn the foundational concepts necessary for building React applications and libraries

# Working effectively with React requires an understanding of JSX and React
# elements. Many engineers work with React for months or years without ever having
# a clear idea of how JSX works or what it even really is. They memorize a list of
# rules and miss out on opportunities to make their code more expressive and
# maintainable. Additionally, building applications in React requires an
# understanding of code reuse through custom components, using and changing data
# over time (state), handling user events, and working with forms.

# In this workshop, you’ll learn everything you need to be effective with the
# fundamental building block of React applications. When you’re finished, you’ll
# be prepared to create React components to build excellent experiences for your
# app's users.
