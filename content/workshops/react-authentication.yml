problemStatements:
  part1: Authenticating your users can be tricky business
  part2: And it can be pretty bad if you get it wrong
  part3: >-
    Sure, you can pay for something off-the-shelf, but that can get expensive
    really quickly and you have to worry about integrating, vendor lock-in, and
    keeping your code up-to-date.
  part4:
    And whether you do decide to pay for an off-the-shelf solution or roll your
    own, you need to figure out how to code up your React components and data
    retrieval code to make sure the right user is shown the right thing at the
    right time. Tricky business indeed.
prerequisite: >-
  You should have experience with [these JavaScript
  features](/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) and attend my [React Hooks
  Workshop](/workshops/react-hooks) or have the equivalent experience.
  Experience with Remix is a bonus, but not a requirement (this workshop will
  still be useful even if you plan to use a different framework). This workshop
  will use TypeScript, but should be completable if you do not have experience
  with TypeScript.
