topics:
  - Manage global application state with context
  - Use React's Suspense feature for code-splitting
  - Build flexible reusable components and hooks
  - Profile application for performance optimizations
prerequisite: >-
  Attend my [Build ReactJS Applications](/workshops/build-react-apps), or have
  equivalent experience building React applications with custom React components
  and the basic React hooks. Attend my [Advanced React Hooks
  Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks), or have the equivalent basic
  experience of using advanced hooks. You should be experienced with
  `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.

# ### Use advanced techniques to optimize ReactJS applications

# We've built the first iteration of a React app, but now it's time to optimize
# our app for performance and maintenance. In this workshop we'll build upon the
# application we built in the first part of this workshop
# ([Build ReactJS Applications](/workshops/build-react-apps)) and improve it using
# proven tools and techniques. We'll cover everything you're likely to run into
# when building frontend React applications like application state management,
# performance profiling and optimizations, and creating reusable components and
# hooks.
