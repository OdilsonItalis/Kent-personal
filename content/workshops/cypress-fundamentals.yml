# ### Use Cypress to write end-to-end tests and be confident that the whole app works together.

# Cypress is an incredibly powerful web testing tool. It’s capable of testing any
# web application. Its architecture places it a cut above similar end-to-end
# testing tools. Its developer experience is best-in-class. And because Cypress
# runs your tests in the same context as the rest of your application, you’re able
# to get speed, reliability, and debuggability that are just a long-distant dream
# with similar tools. The catch? There is no catch. Cypress is exceptional.

# In this workshop, we’ll go over how you can install, configure, and script
# Cypress to test modern, real-world JavaScript web applications.
