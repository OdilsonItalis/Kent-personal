# ### Get up to speed on the latest, most useful JavaScript features to level up your programming

# The ECMAScript standard is now on a yearly release cycle. The 9th edition,
# released in 2018, features async iteration, promise.protoype.finally(),
# rest/spread, and updates to RegExp, and those join a plethora of other powerful
# features released in the last few years.

# For experienced programmers, keeping up with these features makes you more
# productive, your code more expressive and maintainable, and your projects better
# in the long run.

# JavaScript is always improving, and when you keep up with all the updates, you
# can keep improving, too.
