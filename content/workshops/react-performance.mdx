### React is fast, until it isn't

In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to diagnose, profile, and fix
performance problems in your React application using the Browser Performance
Profiler, React DevTools Profiler, and proven React optimization techniques.

The tools we have for profiling React Applications are extremely powerful, but
they can often be really difficult to grok. Sure, starting a profiling session
is simple enough, but how do you go from all the information in the flamegraph
to actionable steps to improve your application's performance? And once you know
what parts of your app are causing performance issues, what then? How do you
optimize your React components without making the whole application a complex
mess?

Oh, and don't forget that you should profile your app in production mode to make
sure you get accurate measurements. Do you know how to do that?

Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop I'll teach you the ins and outs
of optimizing React applications. I will take you on a deep dive browser
profiling tools, and show you what you need to know to start using them to make
your applications fast right away.

## When you are done you will:

<ul>
  <li>profile React components with the React DevTools profiler</li>
  <li>profile JavaScript with the Chrome DevTools profiler</li>
  <li>
    utilize built-in React features (like <code>React.memo</code>,{' '}
    <code>useMemo</code>, and
    <code>useCallback</code>) to optimize React components
  </li>
  <li>
    know how to apply better patterns for application state management to
    optimize components by default
  </li>
</ul>

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [Advanced React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks) or
  have the equivalent experience with advanced React concepts.
