topics:
  - Make the simplest form of a test module and run it with node without any
    libraries
  - Simplify our test with our own assertion library
  - Isolate tests with our own testing framework
  - Support async tests
  - Why and when should you mock JavaScript modules and functions?
  - Use monkey-patch mocking
  - Make assertions to ensure you're calling the mocked functions correctly
  - Mock an entire module

prerequisite: >-
  You should have experience with [these JavaScript
  features](/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react).

# ### Get a solid understanding of automated testing

# Do you know what a testing framework does? Do you know what makes a testing
# framework different from a testing or assertion library? Do you know how and
# when to create mock versions of JavaScript modules? The best way to use a tool
# effectively is to understand how it works. And the best way to understand how a
# tool works is by making it yourself!

# In this workshop, we'll learn how testing frameworks, assertion libraries, and
# mocking libraries work by building our own, simple version of each.
