### Get started building React applications

The React and JavaScript ecosystem is full of tools and libraries to help you
build your applications. In this workshop we’ll build an application from
scratch using widely supported and used tools and techniques. We’ll cover
everything the basics to building frontend React applications like
bootstrapping, styling, and forms.

## Topics

<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap a new react application with create-react-app</li>
  <li>Styling Components</li>
  <li>Manage forms</li>
</ul>

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks), or have the
  equivalent basic experience of using basic hooks. You should be experienced
  with creating custom React components and the `useState`, `useEffect`, and
  `useRef` hooks.
