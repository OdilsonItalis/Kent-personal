### Learn the essential tools and techniques to ship with confidence

Using React to build basic applications is one thing, but shipping those
applications with confidence is an entirely different story. And as you make
changes, how do you know that your changes work? How do you know those changes
aren’t going to break other parts of your application? Do you have to manually
walk through your whole application to make certain everything’s still working?
No thank you! The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the
more confidence they can give you. Let’s learn how to write tests that make us
confident.

Hi, I'm Kent, and I'm the creator of
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)–the React-team
recommended and de-facto standard library for testing React applications. In
this hands-on workshop you'll learn everything you need to test React components
and applications with ease and get the knowledge you need to ship your
applications with confidence.
