topics:
  - profile React components with the React DevTools profiler
  - profile JavaScript with the Chrome DevTools profiler
  - utilize built-in React features (like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and
    `useCallback`) to optimize React components
  - know how to apply better patterns for application state management to
    optimize components by default

prerequisite: >-
  Attend my [Advanced React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks) or
  have the equivalent experience with advanced React concepts. This workshop
  will use TypeScript, but should be completable if you do not have experience
  with TypeScript (or you could attend my [TypeScript to know for
  React](/workshops/typescript-to-know-for-react) workshop first).

# ### React is fast, until it isn't

# In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to diagnose, profile, and fix
# performance problems in your React application using the Browser Performance
# Profiler, React DevTools Profiler, and proven React optimization techniques.

# The tools we have for profiling React Applications are extremely powerful, but
# they can often be really difficult to grok. Sure, starting a profiling session
# is simple enough, but how do you go from all the information in the flamegraph
# to actionable steps to improve your application's performance? And once you know
# what parts of your app are causing performance issues, what then? How do you
# optimize your React components without making the whole application a complex
# mess?

# Oh, and don't forget that you should profile your app in production mode to make
# sure you get accurate measurements. Do you know how to do that?

# Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop I'll teach you the ins and outs
# of optimizing React applications. I will take you on a deep dive browser
# profiling tools, and show you what you need to know to start using them to make
# your applications fast right away.

# ## When you are done you will:
