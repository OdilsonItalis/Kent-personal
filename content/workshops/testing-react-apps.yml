# ### Learn the essential tools and techniques to ship with confidence

# Using React to build basic applications is one thing, but shipping those
# applications with confidence is an entirely different story. And as you make
# changes, how do you know that your changes work? How do you know those changes
# aren’t going to break other parts of your application? Do you have to manually
# walk through your whole application to make certain everything’s still working?
# No thank you! The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the
# more confidence they can give you. Let’s learn how to write tests that make us
# confident.

# Hi, I'm Kent, and I'm the creator of
# [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)–the React-team
# recommended and de-facto standard library for testing React applications. In
# this hands-on workshop you'll learn everything you need to test React components
# and applications with ease and get the knowledge you need to ship your
# applications with confidence.
